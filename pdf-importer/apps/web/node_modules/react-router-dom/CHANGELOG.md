## 6.25.1

### Patch Changes

- Memoize some `RouterProvider` internals to reduce unnecessary re-renders ([#11803](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11803))

- Updated dependencies:
  - `@remix-run/router@1.16.1`
  - `react-router@6.23.1`

## 6.23.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a new `unstable_dataStrategy` configuration option ([#11098](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11098))
  - This option allows Data Router applications to take control over the approach for executing route loaders and actions
  - The default implementation is today's behavior, to fetch all loaders in parallel, but this option allows users to implement more advanced data flows including Remix single-fetch, middleware/context APIs, automatic loader caching, and more

## 6.21.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a new `future.v7_relativeSplatPath` flag to implement a breaking bug fix to relative routing when inside a splat route. ([#11087](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11087))

  This fix was originally added in [#10983](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/10983) and was later reverted in [#11078](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11078) because it was determined that a large number of existing applications were relying on the buggy behavior (see [#11052](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/11052))

  **The Bug**
  The buggy behavior is that without this flag, the default behavior when resolving relative paths is to _ignore_ any splat (`*`) portion of the current route path.

  **The Background**
  This decision was originally made thinking that it would make the concept of nested different sections of your apps in `<Routes>` easier if relative routing would _replace_ the current splat:

  ```jsx
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="dashboard/*" element={<Dashboard />} />
    </Routes>
  </BrowserRouter>
  ```

  Any paths like `/dashboard`, `/dashboard/team`, `/dashboard/projects` will match the `Dashboard` route. The dashboard component itself can then render nested `<Routes>`:

  ```jsx
  function Dashboard() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Dashboard</h2>
        <nav>
          <Link to="/">Dashboard Home</Link>
          <Link to="team">Team</Link>
          <Link to="projects">Projects</Link>
        </nav>

        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<DashboardHome />} />
          <Route path="team" element={<DashboardTeam />} />
          <Route path="projects" element={<DashboardProjects />} />
        </Routes>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

  Now, all links and route paths are relative to the router above them. This makes code splitting and compartmentalizing your app really easy. You could render the `Dashboard` as its own independent app, or embed it into your large app without making any changes to it.

  **The Problem**

  The problem is that this concept of ignoring part of a path breaks a lot of other assumptions in React Router - namely that `"."` always means the current location pathname for that route. When we ignore the splat portion, we start getting invalid paths when using `"."`:

  ```jsx
  // If we are on URL /dashboard/team, and we want to link to /dashboard/team:
  function DashboardTeam() {
    // âŒ This is broken and results in <a href="/dashboard">
    return <Link to=".">A broken link to the Current URL</Link>;

    // âœ… This is fixed but super unintuitive since we're already at /dashboard/team!
    return <Link to="./team">A broken link to the Current URL</Link>;
  }
  ```

  We've also introduced an issue that we can no longer move our `DashboardTeam` component around our route hierarchy easily - since it behaves differently if we're underneath a non-splat route, such as `/dashboard/:widget`. Now, our `"."` links will, properly point to ourself _inclusive of the dynamic param value_ so behavior will break from it's corresponding usage in a `/dashboard/*` route.

  Even worse, consider a nested splat route configuration:

  ```jsx
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="dashboard">
        <Route path="*" element={<Dashboard />} />
      </Route>
    </Routes>
  </BrowserRouter>
  ```

  Now, a `<Link to=".">` and a `<Link to="..">` inside the `Dashboard` component go to the same place! That is definitely not correct!

  Another common issue arose in Data Routers (and Remix) where any `<Form>` should post to it's own route `action` if you the user doesn't specify a form action:

  ```jsx
  let router = createBrowserRouter({
    path: "/dashboard",
    children: [
      {
        path: "*",
        action: dashboardAction,
        Component() {
          // âŒ This form is broken!  It throws a 405 error when it submits because
          // it tries to submit to /dashboard (without the splat value) and the parent
          // `/dashboard` route doesn't have an action
          return <Form method="post">...</Form>;
        },
      },
    ],
  });
  ```

  This is just a compounded issue from the above because the default location for a `Form` to submit to is itself (`"."`) - and if we ignore the splat portion, that now resolves to the parent route.

  **The Solution**
  If you are leveraging this behavior, it's recommended to enable the future flag, move your splat to it's own route, and leverage `../` for any links to "sibling" pages:

  ```jsx
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Routes>
      <Route path="dashboard">
        <Route index path="*" element={<Dashboard />} />
      </Route>
    </Routes>
  </BrowserRouter>

  function Dashboard() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Dashboard</h2>
        <nav>
          <Link to="..">Dashboard Home</Link>
          <Link to="../team">Team</Link>
          <Link to="../projects">Projects</Link>
        </nav>

        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<DashboardHome />} />
          <Route path="team" element={<DashboardTeam />} />
          <Route path="projects" element={<DashboardProjects />} />
        </Router>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

  This way, `.` means "the full current pathname for my route" in all cases (including static, dynamic, and splat routes) and `..` always means "my parents pathname".

### Patch Changes

  - `@remix-run/router@1.14.0`
  - `react-router@6.21.0`

## 6.20.1

### Patch Changes

- Revert the `useResolvedPath` fix for splat routes due to a large number of applications that were relying on the buggy behavior (see <https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/11052#issuecomment-1836589329>). We plan to re-introduce this fix behind a future flag in the next minor version. ([#11078](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11078))
- Updated dependencies:
  - `react-router@6.20.1`
  - `@remix-run/router@1.13.1`

## 6.20.0

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies:
  - `react-router@6.20.0`
  - `@remix-run/router@1.13.0`

## 6.19.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `unstable_flushSync` option to `useNavigate`/`useSumbit`/`fetcher.load`/`fetcher.submit` to opt-out of `React.startTransition` and into `ReactDOM.flushSync` for state updates ([#11005](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11005))
- Allow `unstable_usePrompt` to accept a `BlockerFunction` in addition to a `boolean` ([#10991](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10991))

### Patch Changes

- Fix issue where a changing fetcher `key` in a `useFetcher` that remains mounted wasn't getting picked up ([#11009](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11009))
- Fix `useFormAction` which was incorrectly inheriting the `?index` query param from child route `action` submissions ([#11025](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/11025))
- Fix `NavLink` `active` logic when `to` location has a trailing slash ([#10734](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10734))
- Updated dependencies:
  - `react-router@6.19.0`
  - `@remix-run/router@1.12.0`

## 6.18.0

### Minor Changes

- Add support for manual fetcher key specification via `useFetcher({ key: string })` so you can access the same fetcher instance from different components in your application without prop-drilling ([RFC](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/discussions/7698)) ([#10960](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10960))

  - Fetcher keys are now also exposed on the fetchers returned from `useFetchers` so that they can be looked up by `key`

- Add `navigate`/`fetcherKey` params/props to `useSumbit`/`Form` to support kicking off a fetcher submission under the hood with an optionally user-specified `key` ([#10960](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10960))

  - Invoking a fetcher in this way is ephemeral and stateless
  - If you need to access the state of one of these fetchers, you will need to leverage `useFetcher({ key })` to look it up elsewhere

### Patch Changes

- Adds a fetcher context to `RouterProvider` that holds completed fetcher data, in preparation for the upcoming future flag that will change the fetcher persistence/cleanup behavior ([#10961](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10961))
- Fix the `future` prop on `BrowserRouter`, `HashRouter` and `MemoryRouter` so that it accepts a `Partial<FutureConfig>` instead of requiring all flags to be included. ([#10962](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10962))
- Updated dependencies:
  - `@remix-run/router@1.11.0`
  - `react-router@6.18.0`

## 6.17.0

### Minor Changes

- Add experimental support for the [View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ViewTransition) via `document.startViewTransition` to enable CSS animated transitions on SPA navigations in your application. ([#10916](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10916))

  The simplest approach to enabling a View Transition in your React Router app is via the new `<Link unstable_viewTransition>` prop. This will cause the navigation DOM update to be wrapped in `document.startViewTransition` which will enable transitions for the DOM update. Without any additional CSS styles, you'll get a basic cross-fade animation for your page.

  If you need to apply more fine-grained styles for your animations, you can leverage the `unstable_useViewTransitionState` hook which will tell you when a transition is in progress and you can use that to apply classes or styles:

  ```jsx
  function ImageLink(to, src, alt) {
    let isTransitioning = unstable_useViewTransitionState(to);
    return (
      <Link to={to} unstable_viewTransition>
        <img
          src={src}
          alt={alt}
          style={{
            viewTransitionName: isTransitioning ? "image-expand" : "",
          }}
        />
      </Link>
    );
  }
  ```

  You can also use the `<NavLink unstable_viewTransition>` shorthand which will manage the hook usage for you and automatically add a `transitioning` class to the `<a>` during the transition:

  ```css
  a.transitioning img {
    view-transition-name: "image-expand";
  }
  ```

  ```jsx
  <NavLink to={to} unstable_viewTransition>
    <img src={src} alt={alt} />
  </NavLink>
  ```

  For an example usage of View Transitions with React Router, check out [our fork](https://github.com/brophdawg11/react-router-records) of the [Astro Records](https://github.com/Charca/astro-records) demo.

  For more information on using the View Transitions API, please refer to the [Smooth and simple transitions with the View Transitions API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/view-transitions/) guide from the Google Chrome team.

  Please note, that because the `ViewTransition` API is a DOM API, we now export a specific `RouterProvider` from `react-router-dom` with this functionality. If you are importing `RouterProvider` from `react-router`, then it will not support view transitions. ([#10928](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10928)

### Patch Changes

- Log a warning and fail gracefully in `ScrollRestoration` when `sessionStorage` is unavailable ([#10848](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10848))

### Patch Changes

- Properly encode rendered URIs in server rendering to avoid hydration errors ([#10769](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10769))

## 6.15.0

### Minor Changes

- Add's a new `redirectDocument()` function which allows users to specify that a redirect from a `loader`/`action` should trigger a document reload (via `window.location`) instead of attempting to navigate to the redirected location via React Router ([#10705](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10705))

### Patch Changes

- Fixes an edge-case affecting web extensions in Firefox that use `URLSearchParams` and the `useSearchParams` hook. ([#10620](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10620))
- Do not include hash in `useFormAction()` for unspecified actions since it cannot be determined on the server and causes hydration issues ([#10758](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10758))
- Reorder effects in `unstable_usePrompt` to avoid throwing an exception if the prompt is unblocked and a navigation is performed synchronously ([#10687](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10687), [#10718](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10718))

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies:
  - `react-router@6.14.1`
  - `@remix-run/router@1.7.1`

## 6.14.0

### Minor Changes

- Add support for `application/json` and `text/plain` encodings for `useSubmit`/`fetcher.submit`. To reflect these additional types, `useNavigation`/`useFetcher` now also contain `navigation.json`/`navigation.text` and `fetcher.json`/`fetcher.text` which include the json/text submission if applicable ([#10413](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10413))

  ```jsx
  // The default behavior will still serialize as FormData
  function Component() {
    let navigation = useNavigation();
    let submit = useSubmit();
    submit({ key: "value" }, { method: "post" });
    // navigation.formEncType => "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
    // navigation.formData    => FormData instance

    // await request.text()                => "Text submission"
  }
  ```

### Patch Changes

- When submitting a form from a `submitter` element, prefer the built-in `new FormData(form, submitter)` instead of the previous manual approach in modern browsers (those that support the new `submitter` parameter) ([#9865](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9865), [#10627](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10627))
  - For browsers that don't support it, we continue to just append the submit button's entry to the end, and we also add rudimentary support for `type="image"` buttons
  - If developers want full spec-compliant support for legacy browsers, they can use the `formdata-submitter-polyfill`
- Call `window.history.pushState/replaceState` before updating React Router state (instead of after) so that `window.location` matches `useLocation` during synchronous React 17 rendering ([#10448](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10448))
  - âš ï¸ However, generally apps should not be relying on `window.location` and should always reference `useLocation` when possible, as `window.location` will not be in sync 100% of the time (due to `popstate` events, concurrent mode, etc.)
- Fix `tsc --skipLibCheck:false` issues on React 17 ([#10622](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10622))
- Upgrade `typescript` to 5.1 ([#10581](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10581))
- Updated dependencies:
  - `react-router@6.14.0`
  - `@remix-run/router@1.7.0`

## 6.13.0

### Minor Changes

- Move [`React.startTransition`](https://react.dev/reference/react/startTransition) usage behind a [future flag](https://reactrouter.com/v6/guides/api-development-strategy) to avoid issues with existing incompatible `Suspense` usages. We recommend folks adopting this flag to be better compatible with React concurrent mode, but if you run into issues you can continue without the use of `startTransition` until v7. Issues usually boils down to creating net-new promises during the render cycle, so if you run into issues you should either lift your promise creation out of the render cycle or put it behind a `useMemo`. ([#10596](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10596))

  Existing behavior will no longer include `React.startTransition`:

  ```jsx
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Routes>{/*...*/}</Routes>
  </BrowserRouter>

  <RouterProvider router={router} />
  ```

  If you wish to enable `React.startTransition`, pass the future flag to your component:

  ```jsx
  <BrowserRouter future={{ v7_startTransition: true }}>
    <Routes>{/*...*/}</Routes>
  </BrowserRouter>

  <RouterProvider router={router} future={{ v7_startTransition: true }}/>
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Work around webpack/terser `React.startTransition` minification bug in production mode ([#10588](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10588))
- Updated dependencies:
  - `react-router@6.13.0`

## 6.12.1

> \[!WARNING]
> Please use version `6.13.0` or later instead of `6.12.1`. This version suffers from a `webpack`/`terser` minification issue resulting in invalid minified code in your resulting production bundles which can cause issues in your application. See [#10579](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/issues/10579) for more details.

### Patch Changes

- Adjust feature detection of `React.startTransition` to fix webpack + react 17 compilation error ([#10569](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10569))
- Updated dependencies:
  - `react-router@6.12.1`

## 6.12.0

### Minor Changes

- Wrap internal router state updates with `React.startTransition` if it exists ([#10438](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10438))

### Patch Changes

- Re-throw `DOMException` (`DataCloneError`) when attempting to perform a `PUSH` navigation with non-serializable state. ([#10427](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10427))
- Updated dependencies:
  - `@remix-run/router@1.6.3`
  - `react-router@6.12.0`

## 6.11.2

### Patch Changes

- Export `SetURLSearchParams` type ([#10444](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10444))
- Updated dependencies:
  - `react-router@6.11.2`
  - `@remix-run/router@1.6.2`

## 6.11.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies:
  - `react-router@6.11.1`
  - `@remix-run/router@1.6.1`

## 6.11.0

### Minor Changes

- Enable `basename` support in `useFetcher` ([#10336](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/10336))
